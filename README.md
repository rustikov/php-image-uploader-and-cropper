# php-image-uploader-and-cropper

Nothing fancy, just a simple image AJAX uploader and cropper that utilizes PHP "intervention/image" & JS "cropperjs" libraries. Made for individual use, but feel free to check it out.

index.htm is the start file. Output images are saved inside "images" dir. Other functionality could be figured intuitively, at least that's what I want to believe ;)

PHP 7+ server-side, IE11+ browser support. No NPM used, all CDN includes.
